### **Project: PuzzleVerse - Daily & Standard Puzzles**

### **1. High-Level Summary**

The goal is to create a polished, engaging, and user-friendly native Android application named "PuzzleVerse". The app will serve as a hub for multiple classic puzzle games, each with two modes: a "Standard" mode for casual play and a "Daily Challenge" mode that is consistent for all users each day. The initial game roster will include Sudoku, Bonza, Constellations, Shapes, and Wordle.

The application will be built using modern, best-practice Android development technologies to ensure it is robust, maintainable, and has a high-quality feel.

### **2. Core Features**

*   **Game Hub:** A central home screen to browse and select from the available puzzle games.
*   **Dual Game Modes:**
    *   **Standard Play:** Generate puzzles on-demand for unlimited play.
    *   **Daily Challenge:** A single, unique puzzle for each game, refreshed every 24 hours. Progress and completion will be tracked.
*   **Five Initial Games:**
    *   **Sudoku:** Classic 9x9 number grid puzzle.
    *   **Bonza:** A word puzzle where users connect word fragments on a grid.
    *   **Constellations:** A dot-to-dot puzzle where users connect stars to form shapes without crossing lines.
    *   **Shapes:** A tangram-style puzzle where users fit geometric pieces into a target silhouette.
    *   **Wordle:** The popular 5-letter word guessing game.
*   **Local Progress Storage:** User progress for daily challenges and statistics will be saved on the device.

### **3. Technology Stack & Architecture**

*   **Language:** **Kotlin** - The official language for modern Android development.
*   **UI Toolkit:** **Jetpack Compose** - Google's modern, declarative UI framework for building native interfaces. This allows for faster, more interactive UI development.
*   **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** - A clean, scalable architecture that separates UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model/Repository). This is crucial for managing the state of each complex puzzle game.
*   **Navigation:** **Compose Navigation** - To handle screen transitions and flow within the app.
*   **Data Persistence:** **DataStore** or **Room** - For storing user preferences, daily challenge status, and game statistics locally.

### **4. UI/UX Design Principles**

*   **Theme:** A clean, minimalist, and modern aesthetic based on **Material Design 3**.
*   **User Flow:**
    1.  **App Launch** -> **Home Screen** (Displays a grid or list of games).
    2.  **Select a Game** -> **Game Detail Screen** (Presents "Standard Game" and "Daily Challenge" options).
    3.  **Select a Mode** -> **Game Board Screen** (The interactive puzzle interface).
*   **Visuals:** Simple, intuitive icons and a consistent color palette across all games to create a unified experience.

### **5. Development Plan (Phased Approach)**

**Phase 1: Project Foundation & Core UI**
1.  Set up a new Android Studio project with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
2.  Implement the core navigation structure: Home screen, Game Detail screen, and a placeholder Game Board screen.
3.  Design and build the main UI components (e.g., game selection cards, buttons) according to the Material Design 3 theme.

**Phase 2: First Game Implementation - Sudoku**
1.  Develop the data models for the Sudoku grid.
2.  Build the game logic: puzzle generation (or loading pre-generated puzzles), input validation (checking rows, columns, and 3x3 squares).
3.  Create the interactive Sudoku board UI in Jetpack Compose.
4.  Implement the "Daily Challenge" logic using the current date to seed a puzzle generator or select a pre-defined puzzle.
5.  Integrate local data storage to save the state of the daily challenge.

**Phase 3: Implementing the Remaining Games**
*Using the architecture established in Phase 2 as a template:*
1.  **Wordle:** Implement the 5x6 grid, keyboard, letter evaluation logic, and a local dictionary of valid words.
2.  **Bonza:** Design the data structure for word fragments and their connections. Build the drag-and-drop UI to link them.
3.  **Constellations:** Develop the logic for representing points and connections. Implement the touch-based line drawing on the UI canvas.
4.  **Shapes:** Create the data models for the geometric pieces and the target silhouette. Implement drag, rotate, and snap-to-grid functionality.

**Phase 4: Polish, Settings & Refinement**
1.  Add user settings (e.g., theme selection, sound on/off).
2.  Implement simple animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
3.  Add sound effects for user interactions.
4.  Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing across all games and devices.
