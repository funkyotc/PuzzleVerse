5. Wordle
Description of Gameplay and Rules: Wordle is a word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. For each guess, which must be a valid five-letter word, the game provides color-coded feedback for each letter:
    • Green: The letter is in the secret word and is in the correct position.
    • Yellow: The letter is in the secret word but is in the wrong position.
    • Gray: The letter is not in the secret word at all. Players must use this feedback to deduce the secret word within the six-guess limit.
Win Conditions: The player wins by correctly guessing the secret five-letter word within six attempts. If they fail to guess the word after the sixth attempt, they lose the game.
Development Plan:
    • Phase 1: Core Logic & Game Loop
        ◦ Create two word lists: one comprehensive list of all valid five-letter words for guess validation, and a smaller, curated list of common words to be used as potential secret words.
        ◦ Implement the main game loop: select a random secret word, accept user input, validate the guess against the word list, and provide the color-coded feedback.
        ◦ Develop the logic for handling duplicate letters in guesses and in the secret word (a common challenge in Wordle implementation).
    • Phase 2: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
        ◦ Design the iconic 6x5 grid to display the player's guesses.
        ◦ Create a responsive, on-screen keyboard that is easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
        ◦ The on-screen keyboard should also update with the color-coded feedback to help the player track used and found letters.
        ◦ Implement a smooth tile-flipping animation to reveal the feedback after each guess, adding to the game's dramatic effect.
    • Phase 3: Features and Polish
        ◦ Add a "Daily Challenge" mode, where the secret word is the same for all players for 24 hours.
        ◦ Implement a statistics tracker to store data like games played, win percentage, current streak, and max streak.
        ◦ Create a non-spoiler "Share" feature that allows players to copy their game result (the grid of colored squares) to their clipboard to share on social media.
        ◦ Include a settings menu for features like a high-contrast mode or a dark theme.
    • Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
        ◦ Thoroughly test the word validation and feedback logic with various edge cases (e.g., words with double letters).
        ◦ Ensure the UI is fully responsive and accessible.
        ◦ Deploy the game as a web application.
