4. Shapes (Tangram-style)
Description of Gameplay and Rules: Shapes is a tangram-style puzzle where the player is provided with a set of geometric pieces and a target silhouette. The goal is to arrange all the pieces to perfectly fill the silhouette without any of them overlapping. Players must be able to move, rotate, and sometimes flip the pieces to find the correct orientation and position for each one within the larger shape.
Win Conditions: The game is won when all the provided geometric pieces have been placed inside the target silhouette, completely filling it without any overlap or any part of a piece extending outside the silhouette's boundaries.
Development Plan:
    • Phase 1: Core Logic & Shape Mechanics
        ◦ Define a system for creating geometric shapes (polygons) and the target silhouettes for puzzles.
        ◦ Implement the core user interactions: dragging and dropping shapes, rotating them (e.g., in 90-degree increments), and flipping them horizontally or vertically.
        ◦ Develop a precise collision detection and snapping system that checks if a piece is within the bounds of the silhouette and doesn't overlap with other pieces.
        ◦ Create a function to check for the win condition.
    • Phase 2: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
        ◦ Design a clean game area that displays the target silhouette and a "piece bank" where all available shapes are shown.
        ◦ Ensure the controls for rotating and flipping pieces are intuitive and clearly indicated.
        ◦ Provide satisfying visual feedback, such as a color change or an animation, when a piece is correctly placed within the silhouette.
    • Phase 3: Features and Polish
        ◦ Create a progression of levels with increasingly complex silhouettes.
        ◦ Add different shape sets (e.g., classic tangrams, pentominoes) to provide variety.
        ◦ Implement a hint system that can show the correct outline of one of the pieces within the silhouette.
        ◦ Include a timer or a "best score" system to add replayability.
    • Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
        ◦ Thoroughly test the shape manipulation and placement logic to avoid bugs and frustration.
        ◦ Ensure the game performs well, especially the drag-and-drop and collision detection systems.
        ◦ Deploy the game, potentially with a level editor for community-created content in the future.
