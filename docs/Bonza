2. Bonza
Description of Gameplay and Rules: Bonza is a word puzzle that reinvents the crossword. Players are presented with a collection of disconnected word fragments scattered on a game board. A single clue or theme is provided for the entire puzzle. The goal is to slide these fragments around the board and connect them to form complete words that relate to the puzzle's theme. The words must interlock, similar to a traditional crossword, creating a single, connected word grid.
Win Conditions: The player wins the game when all the word fragments have been correctly assembled into a single, interconnected crossword grid, with all words being valid and fitting the puzzle's theme.
Development Plan:
Phase 1: Core Logic & Puzzle Structure
Design a data structure (e.g., JSON) to define each puzzle, including the theme, the words, and how they are fragmented and positioned on the board.
Implement the core mechanic of dragging and dropping word fragments.
Develop a snapping mechanism that allows fragments to connect when they are placed next to each other correctly.
Create a validation system to check if all fragments are connected and form the intended words.
Phase 2: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
Design an intuitive and visually appealing game board and word fragment elements.
Ensure the drag-and-drop functionality is smooth and responsive, with clear visual cues for valid connections.
Display the puzzle's theme or clue prominently on the screen.
Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile devices.
Phase 3: Features and Polish
Create a variety of puzzle packs with different themes and difficulty levels.
Develop a "Daily Puzzle" feature to encourage player retention.
Implement a hint system that can reveal a correct connection between two fragments or show the position of a specific fragment.
Add satisfying sound effects and animations for when fragments connect correctly.
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
Create a puzzle editor tool for easily creating and testing new Bonza puzzles.
Test the game extensively with different puzzle configurations to ensure stability.
Deploy the game and plan for regular content updates with new puzzle packs.
