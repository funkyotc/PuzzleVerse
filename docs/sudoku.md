1. Sudoku
Description of Gameplay and Rules: Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The game is played on a 9x9 grid, which is partially filled with numbers. The objective is to fill the remaining empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9. The core rule is that each number from 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that make up the main grid. Players must use logic and deduction to figure out the correct placement of each number, as no guessing is required.
Win Conditions: The game is won when the entire 9x9 grid is correctly filled with numbers according to the rules, meaning:
Every cell contains a number from 1 to 9.
There are no duplicate numbers in any single row.
There are no duplicate numbers in any single column.
There are no duplicate numbers in any single 3x3 subgrid.
Development Plan:
Phase 1: Core Logic & Puzzle Generation
Implement a data structure to represent the 9x9 Sudoku board.
Develop a backtracking algorithm to generate valid, fully-solved Sudoku boards.
Create a puzzle generator by removing numbers from a solved board to create a puzzle of a certain difficulty. The difficulty can be determined by the number of cells removed and the complexity of logical deduction required.
Write a validation function to check if a player's move is valid against the game rules and to determine the win condition.
Phase 2: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
Design and build a clean and responsive 9x9 grid using HTML and CSS.
Implement cell selection and number input functionality (either through keyboard or an on-screen number pad).
Add visual feedback for the user, such as highlighting the selected cell, its corresponding row, column, and subgrid.
Implement a feature to highlight incorrect number placements in real-time.
Phase 3: Features and Polish
Introduce multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert).
Add an "Undo" button to revert the last move.
Implement a "Notes" or "Pencil Marks" feature that allows players to enter small candidate numbers in a cell.
Include a hint system that can either solve a single cell or highlight possible errors.
Add a timer to track the player's completion time.
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
Conduct thorough testing to ensure the puzzle generation and validation logic are flawless.
Perform cross-browser and mobile device testing to ensure a consistent user experience.
Deploy the game as a standalone web application or as part of the PuzzleVerse collection.
